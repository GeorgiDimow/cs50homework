Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized for the first three places after about 100.
For the other predicitions it's after 1000.
Bettween 100 and 1000 times is "good enough".
